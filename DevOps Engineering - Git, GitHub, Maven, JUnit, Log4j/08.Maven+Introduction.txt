Maven Introduction:
=====================
What is a Resource?
--------------------------
* A File or Program of an Application is called Resource

What is Build Process?
* Keeping Resources Ready
* Arranging Resources in Various Folders
* Adding Libraries/Jars to classpath
* Compilation
* Execution
* Testing
* Packaging for release or deployment is continously required in project development 
  and Delivery Process

Note : 
--------------
Keeping Our Project Ready for execution / Release is called Build Process
This involves multiple complicated and repetitive operations


Core Java Project:
----------------------
1)Develop Java Resources and other files
2)Keep them in  different folders
3)Add Jars  / Libraries in Class Path
4)Compilation
5)Execution / Testing
6)Packing the Project For Release (jar | war )

Unit Testing : Programmers testing on their own piece of code is called Unit Testing

Performing Build Process Activities manually is having lot of limitations:
================================================================================
1)Remebering Complicated and Repetitive Operations is very tough
2)We may mismatch order
3)We may forget certian activities
4)Doing multiple activities of Build Process Manually will waste our time and etc


Batch (.bat) :
------------------
Batch is given to combine related commands into single command (By using single command we can
automate the process)


>run.bat
  cd T:
  mkdir MyProject
  copy source file into destination 
  set path=......
  set classpath=.....
  javac -d . *.java
  java <pakg>.<Main Class>

Limitations of Batch File:
=======================================
1)Conditional Execution is not possible
2)We cannot create Dependency Among Operations
3)Jars files must be added manually
4)If one command fails in batch file , then next command will not execute
5)It is not declarative(not self intelligent, ie. we need to tell eveything what  to do)

To Overcome above limitations we got ANT Tool (Another Neat Tool):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Same as batch file,but we can keep operations as conditional operations and we can maintain 
  depedency amoug operations

To overcome above limitations with Batch and ANT Tools we got maven tool introduced with lot of advanced
features

* ANT is just Build Tool .... 
* Maven is a Build Tool and Project Management Tool
* Maven is a build automation tool used promarily for java projects

Archetypes : Project Templates

* Archetypes are templates to create projects
  a)maven-archetype-quickstart : Standalone projects
  b)maven-archetype-webapp     : Web Applications
 
Key Features of Maven:
===========================
1)Maven tries to avoid as much configurations as possible , by choosing real worl default values and 
supplying project templates
2)Download JAR Files Dynamically
3)Can maintain multiple repositories having jar files ,plugins etc
4)Provides Standard Project Directory Structures
5)Alows to develop multiple module projects
6)Has the capability to generate WAR[Web Application Archive]  ,JAR [Java Application Archive ] OR
  EAR [ Enterprise Application Archive ]
7)Can Run Unit Tests and can generate unit test reports
8)Can generate Project Documentation
9)Can clean and install projects in local servers or remote servers

Maven Can be Used As
 1)From CLI (Command Line Interface)
 2)From IDE (Integrated Development Environment] : STS ,ECLIPSE ,MYSCLIPSE ,NETBEANS
